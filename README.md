Issues:
- Currently users can NOT add/remove from InfoWindow, to be implemented in the future
- InfoWindows don't close on list view search


To-Dos:
- Menu
- Close InfoWindows on List View Search
- Responsive Design for Mobile
    - Cohesive and enjoyable user experience
- ~~Search Bar: filters both list view and markers~~
- ~~List View: filters through searched locations and opens associated marker~~
- ~~"Unique Functionality"~~
    - Route making counts...right?
- Incorporate Build Process
    - Production quality minified code
- Data persists when app is opened and closed
    - Firebase/localStorage
- ~~Populates dynamic model with info retrieved from API~~
- ~~Error handling for API~~
- Include third-party API beyond what's required
- ~~Style marker differently and usefully~~
- Search function is optimized and provides things like autocomplete
- README file detailing steps on how to run the project
- Comments are concise and self documenting
- Code ready for personal review
